# Recipe Transformer for EECS 337
## by Pete Huang, Frank Avino, Nevil George, Brendan Frick


## Let's write good code
We didn't end up with neat code at the end of our last project. Let's try to change that by following these style guidelines:

- Place all essential logic/code in main.py. What is not "essential" to our project should be in a separate file/module.
- Create a new file for each class you write. Import them into the main.py script by adding ```from <<filename>> import <<classname>>``` to the top of the script.
- When installing a module/package, only include the functions that you need in the script using ```from <<filename>> import <<classname>>```
- Class names should start with a capital letter (obviously)
- If your file is a module that you will later be importing to another file, the file name should also start with a capital letter
- Feel free to contribute directly to this repo. Ideally, create a new branch and then merge with master when you have your feature working corectly

__Add more to this style guide if you'd like!__
